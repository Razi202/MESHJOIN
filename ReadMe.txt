-> I created an extra DDL function in my java file that creates tables when you will run the file. Comment it if you only want to use the DDL SQL file.

-> For the java file to run, you must include the two jar files I included in the folder (if you don't already have them).

-> To include jar files, go the your project's 'properties' option and use 'Java Build Path'.

-> To connect to your database, you will have to input your schema name, username, and password. (You won't have to edit anything, the code will ask you)

-> My code is straightforward so I don't think you will need anything else to run the code.

-> There is "package SQL" on the top of the code. Change it according to you own project or the code might not run.
